# DogAndroidApp
Android project to display list of dogs and details on each dog


# Details
This is a project I made to show off and learn android skills including, jetpack compose, retrofit factory for api calls and using compose navigation to navigate between screens. Also uses dependency injection and a view state driven ui approach

# API credit
I used https://dogapi.dog/docs/api-v2 to get the list of dog breeds and the details on each dog breed for the details screen
